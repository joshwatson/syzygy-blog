&lt;p&gt;The numbers don’t lie, even if the officials do. People are vanishing. Not just a few. Not just here and there. &lt;strong&gt;Hundreds&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. And not the kind of people who get press coverage. Not the kind who have families that can afford billboards and search parties.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</summary>

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about the Mole People again. You remember them—those subterranean entities that emerged from beneath the city, not from the sewers, but from the ancient layers of earth that predate our maps, our buildings, even our understanding of what this planet is. They’re not rats. They’re not mutants. They’re something older. Something deliberate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I told you all that mutant rats had emerged from the sewers, evolving past anything science or magic could explain. And while that post was based on the truth as I understood it then, I now realize how deeply misled I was. The creatures we saw that night were &lt;strong&gt;not rats at all&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. The glow, the sigils, the unnatural way they moved—they were &lt;strong&gt;something far worse&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were &lt;strong&gt;Mole People&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</summary>

The sewers, packed with chemical runoff, discarded pharmaceuticals, and now—thanks to the greed of megacorporations—&lt;strong&gt;residual arcane energy&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, have become the perfect breeding ground for creatures beyond natural comprehension. I’ve heard whispers, collected fragmented stories, but no one ever took them seriously. I never had undeniable proof.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

They’ve been whispered about in hushed tones, feared by those who’ve encountered them, and dismissed by the ignorant. But now, a disturbing new pattern has emerged—one that cannot be ignored. Our nation’s bikers—those fearless road warriors who embrace the open highways—are disappearing. And the evidence is clear: the Men in Black are responsible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</summary>
