        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I need to correct a mistake. A grave mistake.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I told you all that mutant rats had emerged from the sewers, evolving past anything science or magic could explain. And while that post was based on the truth as I understood it then, I now realize how deeply misled I was. The creatures we saw that night were &lt;strong&gt;not rats at all&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. The glow, the sigils, the unnatural way they moved—they were &lt;strong&gt;something far worse&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were &lt;strong&gt;Mole People&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</summary>

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For years, I’ve warned about the strange mutations lurking beneath our cities. The sewers, packed with chemical runoff, discarded pharmaceuticals, and now—thanks to the greed of megacorporations—&lt;strong&gt;residual arcane energy&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, have become the perfect breeding ground for creatures beyond natural comprehension. I’ve heard whispers, collected fragmented stories, but no one ever took them seriously. I never had undeniable proof.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</summary>

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For years, the shadowy presence of the Men in Black has haunted the edges of our reality. They’ve been whispered about in hushed tones, feared by those who’ve encountered them, and dismissed by the ignorant. But now, a disturbing new pattern has emerged—one that cannot be ignored. Our nation’s bikers—those fearless road warriors who embrace the open highways—are disappearing. And the evidence is clear: the Men in Black are responsible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</summary>
