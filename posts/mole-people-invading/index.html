    <p>I need to correct a mistake. A grave mistake.</p>
<p>In my last post, I told you all that mutant rats had emerged from the sewers, evolving past anything science or magic could explain. And while that post was based on the truth as I understood it then, I now realize how deeply misled I was. The creatures we saw that night were <strong>not rats at all</strong>. The glow, the sigils, the unnatural way they moved—they were <strong>something far worse</strong>.</p>
<p>They were <strong>Mole People</strong>.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>I know what you're thinking. Mole People—those whispered legends, dismissed by the blind masses as myth, as exaggeration. But I am telling you now, with certainty, that they are <strong>real</strong>, and they are <strong>not our friends</strong>. They are <strong>not emerging from the sewers</strong>—they are <strong>climbing up from deep beneath the surface</strong>, from the layers of forgotten tunnels, ancient caverns, and the forbidden depths that humanity has long ignored.</p>
<p>That night was <strong>not the first sighting</strong>. I have spent the last 24 hours scouring old reports, digging up every shred of evidence that proves their existence. <strong>It is all there</strong>—decades of unexplained disappearances, sewer workers who never returned, strange claw marks found on the walls of underground passages. And more disturbing than anything: <strong>corporate excavation projects that have mysteriously shut down with no explanation</strong>.</p>
<p>What are they hiding? What <strong>did they uncover</strong>?</p>
<p>And why are the Mole People emerging now?</p>
<p>I am convinced that they are no longer content with the underground. <strong>They are preparing for something bigger</strong>. For years, megacorporations have drilled into the planet’s surface with reckless abandon, fusing magic and technology in ways no one fully understands. The result? Corruption—residual energy leaking down into the depths, <strong>awakening forces we were never meant to disturb</strong>.</p>
<p>The Mole People have adapted. The sigils flickering under their skin were <strong>not mutations</strong>—they were <strong>ritual markings</strong>, <strong>symbols of their hidden civilization</strong>, of an ancient magic <strong>twisted by industrial experimentation</strong>. If they healed their wounded last night using arcane power, what else are they capable of? <strong>What weapons do they wield?</strong></p>
<p>I am telling you now—<strong>this is an invasion</strong>.</p>
<p>This isn’t just about them surfacing for food or shelter. <strong>This is the beginning of their plan</strong>, the first move in a long, calculated game that has been brewing beneath us for years, possibly decades. They have waited. They have <strong>watched us</strong>. And now, when our cities are weakest, when corporate corruption has blurred the lines between magic and science—<strong>they are making their move</strong>.</p>
<p>Do not believe the officials who will dismiss this as nonsense. Do not trust the corporate spokesmen who will tell you this is a hoax.</p>
<p>The Mole People are <strong>here</strong>, and they are <strong>not stopping</strong>.</p>
<p>This city is just the beginning.</p>
